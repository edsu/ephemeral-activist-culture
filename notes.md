## Zinn

I was at SAA last year (2014) at a panel that Hillel Arnold put together called Agency, Ethics and Information. The panel focused on the role that power plays in the activities and architecture of the archive, especially how this power manifests itself in the network. This is a quote from Howard Zinn that continues to speak (at least for me) about the need to be aware of how power shapes our work as archivists, and to dispel notions of our neutrality.

In the Q&A period, someone asked the panel a question about what everyone was doing to archive content related to the protests in Ferguson, Missouri that had erupted after the killing of Michael Brown a few days earlier. We all nodded and said that something should be done, especially in Twitter. But nobody had concrete suggestions about what to do.

In the hotel bar later I happened to talk briefly to Bergis, who impressed on me the importance of acting now. So I used a tool I had written previously to do some data collection.  I was also transitioning from working at the Library of Congress to a new job in the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities at UMD, where I had the support of MITH's director, Neil Fraistat.

Since you have Bergis here, who can speak to the motivations and importance of
this work. I'm going to use my panel time to talk a bit about the data
collection and some activities at the University of Maryland since then. 

## twarc.py

So I mentioned that we did this data collection using a tool I created. It is really just a small command line tool that uses the Twitter API to collect  JSON data for reach tweet. I'll show you some JSON data in a moment. I was just at a conference last week 

Written in Python and should be installable and run on OSX, Windows and Linux.
Designed to be run continuously on a machine that stays on the Internet.

twarc began as a small project in 2013 to collect tweets memorializing Aaron Swartz, who committed suicide after being targeted by the Justice Department for his online activism work.

SFM is a project from GWU funded by IMLS and the National Historical Publications & Records Commission (NHPRC). Bergis was instrumental in getting that work started while he was at GWU.

## Twitter Archiving Google Spreadsheet (TAGS)

Started in 2010. Collects Twitter data from the search API and puts it into a Google Spreadsheet. Having the content in a Google spreadsheet is perfect for analysis and computation.  But from an archival perspective it is somewhat limited because it neither provides the full JSON data from Twitter, or the snapshot of the webpage.

## Terms of Service

While our workshops were focused on empowering students and faculty to do their own data collection, they were often followed by requests from people who wanted to work directly with the Ferguson data.

Twitter limits the way this data can be shared on the Internet. We've shared
some lists of Twitter identifiers publicly at the Internet Archive. But so far
we've only been sharing this data locally at the University of Maryland. We have
our own dataset archive (really just bagit bags on Amazon S3) which we have made
available to researchers on request.

In some ways I think the restrictions of the Twitter API have allowed us to
sidestep some important discussions around privacy and ethics of access to this
data. As you may have heard, news organizations such as St Louis Public Radio
were issued a sobpoena for access to materials related to the shooting of Mansur
Ball-Bey. When we create collections like this is important to have answers to
these questions ready? Heather MacNeill's work.
